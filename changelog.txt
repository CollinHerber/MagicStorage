- Added a new module to the Storage Configuration Interface:  [b]Use Journey Mode Infinite Items[/b]
- Added a new help tip from the Automaton regarding Storage Units
- Made the logic responsible for checking if a player can be connected to a storage system from a Portable Access happen less often in order to reduce lag
- Fixed a bug which caused tiles to run their "nearby effects" logic more often than they should've been
- Reorganized the client config and made it look better
- Renamed the Sort by Quantity sorting option to [b]Sort by Total Quantity[/b]
- Renamed the Sort by Quantity Ratio sorting option to [b]Sort by Stack Count[/b]
- Added icons for the "newer" filtering icons, which previously just used the same icon as the miscellaneous filter
- Fixed a bug which caused the Delete Unloaded Items button in the Storage UI's Controls panel to do nothing
- Fixed a bug where opening a portable Storage access and then trying to open a portable Crafting access (or vice versa) would just cause the UI to close
- Tweaked the logic for loading some edits to make them not cause the mod to fail to load on 1.4dev (tModLoader v9999.0) builds
- Fixed some oversights which caused the Filter Items Fully Researched and Filter Items Not Fully Researched filters to do nothing when used
