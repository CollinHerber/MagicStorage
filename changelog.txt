- [b]Reimplemented the "Search by Mod" button that had been removed in update v0.5.7[/b]
- Modified the search bar's help text to only use the [i]@ModName[/i] help text when not using the "All Mods" mod search

- Added hover text to the search bars explaining how the [i]@ModName[/i] and [i]#Search Tooltip[/i] searches work
- Properly implemented the [b]ItemCombining[/b] API in places where it wasn't used, but should have been

- Renamed the "Use Inventory Module" module to "Use Player Inventory Items" and extended its usage to include the ammo and coin slots
- Added a "Use Non-Favorited Player Inventory Items" module
- Fixed a bug which would sometimes cause the UI to require two inventory key presses to close

- Fixed a bug which allowed empty slots in the Crafting UI's Stored Ingredients zone to be blacklisted as ingredients
- Fixed a bug which caused the Crafting UI's Stored Ingredients zone to sometimes overlap the mass crafting buttons
- Fixed a bug which allowed infinite duplication of items from the Crafting UI's result slot
- Added logic to make the UIs recalculate their bounds when the game's resolution changes and improved the logic that handles detecting the change for UI Scale as well
- Fixed various oversights in the item withdrawal/deposit code
- Modified the sorting/filtering icon alignments to be more accurate at lower scales
- Fixed the Quick Stack logic (from the inventory button) being broken in multiplayer
- Added a highly-requested feature:  [b]Recipe History[/b]
- Removed the [i]Filter Unstackables[/i] and [i]Filter Stackables[/i] filtering options
- [i]Filter Armor and Equipment[/i] is now hidden when [i]Filter Armor[/i] and [i]Filter Equipment[/i] are easily accessible
- Added an error message that's printed to the chat when the Storage/Crafting UIs are too small to properly create and align all UI elements
- Fixed an oversight which caused clicking empty slots in the Storage UI to refresh the UI
- Fixed a bug where the ModernDropdown layout's dropdown menu's scroll bars would still make noise when not visible
- Fixed a few bugs which prevented the [i]Item debug information[/i] config and [i]Print Item Data[/i] keybinding from being handled properly
- Fixed various bugs caused by not properly checking if certain configs have changed
- Modified the message displayed by the [i]Print Item Data[/i] keybinding to be less misleading
- Fixed various bugs which caused the Sell Duplicates logic to not work as intended
- Added a safeguard for a tModLoader bug which would sometimes cause the scroll bars in Magic Storage to stop working
- Fixed an oversight which allowed Inactive Storage Units to be considered as valid "destinations" for item transfers
- Fixed a bug which would sometimes cause the mass crafting logic to incorrectly cap the amount of resulting items requested
- Added a warning that's printed to the chat whenever a combination of filtering options causes no entries to exist, when they would exist otherwise.  This is just an indicator for already-existing filtering logic so that it's less confusing.
[b]NOTE: The "item transfers cause items to temporarily disappear" bug in Multiplayer has not been fixed yet.[/b]
